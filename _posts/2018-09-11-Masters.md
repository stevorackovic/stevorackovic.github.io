In September 2018,  I earned an MSc degree in Applied Mathematics - Data Science at the Faculty of Sciences UNS. This two-year master's program focused on extracting knowledge from data, utilizing ML, DL, optimization, and signal processing tools. My master thesis, titled "Parallel Implementation of Machine Learning Algorithms using PyCOMPSs," concerns the software developed by the I-BiDaaS project and was conducted under the supervision of professor Dušan Jakovetić.
