With two colleagues from the BIGMATH program, Filipa Valdeira (University of Milan) and Rongjiao Ji (University of Milan),
we won third place in the e-Poster competition for the graduate students, with the title 'Meet my Avatar'. 
This work merges ideas from our three research fields: inverse rig estimation, face reconstruction, and emotion recognition.
