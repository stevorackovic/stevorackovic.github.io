With Filipa Valdeira (University of Milan) and Greta Malaspina (University of Novi Sad), we won the first place in the 
[ECMI 2021 Student Competition](https://ecmiindmath.org/2021/06/07/ecmi-2021-students-competition/).

The goal was to produce a mathematical model that would fit the data of COVID-19 in Great Britain and Israel.
We will present our solution at the Educational Committee of ECMI next spring, 
and now we are invited to make a full paper for publication with more detailed experiments and final conclusions.
