I was invited to present my research results at Εuro 2021, the largest and most important conference for Operational Research and Management Science (OR/MS) in Europe organized by EURO – the European Association of Operational Research Society and the Hellenic Operational Research Society (HELORS). It was great to go to a conference in person again!
