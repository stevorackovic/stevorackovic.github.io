Abstract 
--------

We propose a method to fit arbitrarily accurate blendshape rig models by solving the inverse rig problem in realistic human face animation. The method considers blendshape models with different levels of added corrections and solves the regularized least-squares problem using coordinate descent, i.e., iteratively estimating blendshape weights. Besides making the optimization easier to solve, this approach ensures that mutually exclusive controllers will not be activated simultaneously and improves the goodness of fit after each iteration. We show experimentally that the proposed method yields solutions with mesh error comparable to or lower than the state-of-the-art approaches while significantly reducing the cardinality of the weight vector (over 20 percent), hence giving a high-fidelity reconstruction of the reference expression that is easier to manipulate in the post-production manually. Python scripts for the algorithm will be publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.
